# VueJs

Author: [Lu Lechuan](https://github.com/LuLechuan), [Chelsey Ong](https://github.com/chelseyong)

VueJs (also known as Vue) is an open-source [JavaScript framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_framework) for building user interfaces. It is designed to improve code quality and maintainablity.

## Creating a Simple Project in VueJs

#### Installation

There are [multiple ways to install VueJs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html) and they are all easy. For example, one of the easiest ways is to run the npm command `$ npm install vue`.

Apart from installing VueJs, you can install [VueJs development tools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools#vue-devtools) in your browser. This will allow you to inspect and debug the components that use VueJs in your projects.

#### HelloWorld in VueJs

This is a simple example to show how easy it is to integrate VueJs into your web project:<br/><br/>
The main HTML file:
```HTML
<body>
  <div id="root">
    <h2>{{ message }}</h2>
  </div>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@2.5.13/dist/vue.js"></script>
  <script src="the_path_to_the_javacript_file.js"></script>
</body>
```
This is inside the javacript file:
```js
new Vue ({
  el: '#root',

  data: {
    message: "Hello World"
  }
});
```

++Step-by-step explanation of the code++

<b>Step 1:</b> Import VueJs CDN and the JavaScript file in the main HTML file.
```HTML
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@2.5.13/dist/vue.js"></script>
  <script src="the_path_to_the_javacript_file.js"></script>
```

<b>Step 2:</b> Create an instance of Vue (Vue is an object) in the JavaScript file; bind the instance to one of the component in our html file (e.g. create a component with id `root` and bind it with the instance of Vue).<br/>
In this case, only the `root` component can be accessed in VueJs while the rest are unaffected. This is how we progressively plug in VueJs into our projects.

```js
  new Vue ({
    el: '#root',
  });
```
```HTML
  <div id="root"></div>
```

<b>Step 3:</b> Specify our data (message: "Hello World") in the instance of Vue Class.
```js
  data: {
    message: "Hello World"
  }
```

<b>Step 4:</b> Pass the message to the HTML file using double curly brackets.
```HTML
  <div id="root">
    <h2>{{ message }}</h2>
  </div>
```

<b>Step 5:</b> Open the brower and we will see "Hello World" being displayed:
> <h2>Hello World</h2>
<br>

## Advantages and Disadvantages of VueJs

#### Advantages of VueJs

1. **Approachable:**<br/>
VueJs is very easy to learn. Compared to other framework such as Angular and ReactJs, VueJs is simple in term of API and design. Learning enough to build non-trivial applications typically takes less than a day. An example is provided below:<br/><br/>
How is iteration like in ReactJs:<br/><br/>
The JavaScript file in ReactJs
    ```js
    var Iteration = React.createClass({
       getInitialState() {
         return {
           array: ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"]
         }
       },
       render() {
         this.state.array.map(function(date) {
           return (
             <span>{date}</span>
           )
         });
       }
    });
    ReactDOM.render(<Iteration />, document.getElementById('array'));
    ```
    The HTML file in ReactJs
    ```html
    <div id="array"></div>
    ```
    How is iteration like in VueJs:<br/><br/>
    The JavaScript file in VueJs
    ```js
    var Iteration = new Vue({
      el: '#array',
      data: {
        array: ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"]
      }
    });
    ```
    The HTML file in VueJs
    ```html
    <div id="array">
      <span v-for="date in array">{{date}}</span>
    </div>
    ```

2. **Progressive:**<br/>
VueJs is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. This means that if you have a large application, you can plug VueJs into just a part of your application without disturbing the other components. A quote from Evan You - the founder of VueJs is as follow:
    > Vue.js is a more flexible, less opinionated solution (than Angular). That allows you to structure your app the way you want it to be, instead of being forced to do everything the Angular way (Angular requires a certain way to structure an application, making it hard to introduce Angular into an already built project). Itâ€™s only an interface layer so you can use it as a light feature in pages instead of a full blown SPA (single-page application).

3. **Versatile:**<br/>
VueJs is perfectly capable of powering sophisticated single-page applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

4. **Clean:**<br/>
VueJs syntax is simple and this can make the HTML pages very clean. This would allow user interfaces built by VueJs to be more maintainable and testable.

#### Disadvantages of VueJs

1. **Relatively small size community:**<br/>
VueJs is a relatively new JavaScript framework as compared to Angular and React. The size of the community for VueJs is therefore relatively small. Although small size community means you can differentiate yourself from other JavaScript developers, it also means there are fewer resources such as tutorials and problem-shooting guides.

2. **Language barriers:**<br/>
A majority of users of VueJs are the Chinese as VueJs is developed by a Chinese American. He is supportive of the Chinese community and hence a lot of the existing plugins are written in Chinese. There might be some language barriers for an English speaking developer seeking for VueJs resources.

### Special features of VueJs
Here are some features that VueJs differ from the other frameworks used:
1. **Mutating of data in the DOM**

In Vue, the state of the data can be directly modified. Let's say, there is a message in your app. To change the message, insert this line:
```js
this.message = 'Hello Space';
```

In React, such a direct modification of data is not allowed, due to React's need to rerun lifecycle hooks after state is being updated. Data can only be updated using `this.setState` method.
```js
this.setState({ message: 'Hello Space' });
```
<br>

2. **2-way binding**: `v-model` is used to bind the DOM input field to its data variable. This effectively allows your DOM variables to be automatically in sync with your data, regardless of which one is being updated.
In other words, this reduces the need for you to manually update your data.
```js
<input type="checkbox", v-model=isChecked">
    <label for="checked">Select</label>
```
<br>

3. **1-way data flow**: Data can only be passed from parent to child, via `props`.
Props can be of any data type, including Objects.

In the code below, `to-do list` is the parent and `item` is the child.
The data in `item` is being passed to `todo-list` for rendering.
```js
Vue.component('todo-list', {
    props: ['item'],
    data: ['totalCount'],
    template:
      <div class='todo-list'>
        <p>Total:{{ this.totalCount }}</p>
        <p>{{ item.name }}: {{ item.count }}</p>
})

<todo-list
  v-for='item in items'
  v-bind:key='item.id'
  v-bind:item='item'
></todo-list>
```


However, what if the user decides to update the `item.count`? The data for item.count has to be passed from `item` to `todo-list` so `totalCount` can be updated inside `todo-list` . Under situations like this where the child has to pass data back to the parent, the child component has to [emit events](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Emitting-a-Value-With-an-Event)
and the parent component will update after listening to these events.

```js
Vue.component('item', {
  data: ['count', 'name'],
  template: {
    <button v-on:click="$emit('increased-count', count+1)">Increment count for this item</button>
  }
}

// Inside todo-list component
template:
    v-on:increased-count="updateCount"
```
Whenever the button is pressed, an event called `increased-count` with the new value of `count` will be emitted by the child `item`.
When `todo-list` listened to the event, it will execute `updateCount`.

Using 1-way data flow ensures that the data can only be changed by the component itself and allows bugs to be easily traced in the code.
<br>


4. **Computed properties**: Useful when you want to reduce the amount of logic written in templates

Using the example from above, we can convert `totalCount` into a computed property.

```js
computed: totalCount() {
    let result = 0
    this.items.forEach((item) => result += item.count);
    return result;
}
```

Unlike the use of methods, this updating of `totalCount` will only be triggered when the number of `items` in the list or any `item`'s `count` changed.
This can greatly improve the efficiency of your application, as computed properties will not run every time
the page refreshes.
